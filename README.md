# Toygar
 
## Hello

Toygar is Next-Gen ORM. It is code first ORM.

This is the first version of the ORM architecture that I call the new Open source "Toygar". 
"Toygar" -> means lark. This architecture was primarily designed to solve the problem in distributed structures. 
Currently, there is a Console Application that shows the usage in a very simple way, as I have not been able to document it yet.
It applies the entity structure to the database with the code first structure. 
Layz loading available. A Linq-like language has been developed for queries. 


- Define your child DBs
- You can define same domain diffrent DB
- You can define diffrent domain same DB
- You can define diffrent domain diffrent DB
- what is cBaseTestEntity mean. this meain is TestDB2 table is extending from cBaseTestEntity.
- So those classes will create Tables in TestDB2 drived by cBaseTestEntity
